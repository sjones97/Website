## Filtering Columns and Rows
In SQL, one can filter columns and rows of a selected table.Columns can be filtered using the SELECT command, and rows can be filtered using the WHERE command. Following is an example of this using the Lahman baseball database.

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
```



```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,HR from Batting WHERE teamID='NYA'and yearID=1927"

sqldf(query)
```


### Examples

Find all instances where yankees have hit forty or more homeruns.


```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,HR FROM Batting WHERE teamID='NYA' and HR>=40"

sqldf(query)
```

##Order By

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE HR>50
ORDER BY HR DESC"
sqldf(query)
```
